# The goal of this project

This is a complete restart of my Palm OS emulator, with the last one the code got too messy and the goal too ambitious(to emulate every palm API in software and for compatibility with all Palm OS versions and devices).

To emulate every part of the Palm m515 that is used by the OS perfectly.
This means no hacks like POSE where API calls are intercepted and replaced with those that dont use the actual hardware.
It is also written in C for RetroArch so it will run on everything at the start, not just Win95 like POSE and Copilot and is being developed with modern emulator features in mind, save/load state and overclocking are available from the start.

## Why the m515?

It is the best Palm brand OS 4 device that has no special hardware builtin(cellphone, barcode scanner, keyboard attachment), it has a color screen, and available ROM dumps.

## What about accessories?

The Palm keyboard attachment will likely be emulated later on so the PC keyboard can be used on text fields.

## What about OS 5?

I am planning on adding Tungsten T3 support as soon as possible.

## Building

For systems supported by RetroArch, you may download builds
directly from and install them manually, if not using the
_Online Updater_ functionality:

 * <https://git.libretro.com/libretro/Mu/-/pipelines>

#### Using CMake

Using CMake, you just need to do:

 * `cmake .`
 * `cmake --build .`
   * You may specify a CMake target.

#### For RetroArch

There are two options available for RetroArch, you can use CMake
to build the core, or you can use the older Makefile based setup.
The Makefile based setup is for the older RetroArch build system.

##### CMake

Same as above for _CMake_, the RetroArch specific target is
in this case `mu_libretro`. This will output a file accordingly.
Note that if you are using a system which uses static binaries,
such as the PS2 or 3DS, there are other steps you must complete,
although it is recommended to just download from
here <https://git.libretro.com/libretro/Mu/-/pipelines>.

##### Makefile 

Make sure you have done all the steps here https://docs.libretro.com/ under "For Developers/Compilation" so you build environment works.  

    cd ./libretroBuildSystem
    make

To load multiple files at once, place PRCs and PDBs into a ZIP file and then
load that ZIP file. PDBs will be installed first followed by PRC files.

#### For Qt

First install _Qt 5.14.2_, you may optionally install as well _Qt Creator_.

 * Windows: <https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.14.2.exe>
 * Mac: <https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/qt-opensource-mac-x64-5.14.2.dmg>
 * Linux: <https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.14.2.run>

You need the following components of Qt5:

 * Core
 * Gui
 * Widgets
 * Multimedia
 * Svg

When running _CMake_ you will need to pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the
location of `Qt5Config.cmake`.

 * With _Qt 5.14.2_ on Windows building with...
   * mingw-w64: `C:\qt\Qt5.14.2\5.14.2\mingw73_64\lib\cmake\Qt5`
   * Visual Studio: `C:\qt\Qt5.14.2\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\lib\cmake\Qt5`

If you are using CLion, you may need to go into _Settings_ ->
_Build, Execution, Deployment_ -> _CMake_ and add it to _CMake Options_.

For Qt Creator, open the `.pro` file and click "Run" or build from
command line.

If you get `error: 'thread' in namespace 'std' does not name a type` while
trying to build the Qt Project then you should install the _POSIX Threaded_
variant of Mingw-w64 and not the _Win32 Threaded_ variant.

#### TestSuite for Palm OS
Install prc-tools from the below link(self compiled or prepackaged VM)  

    cd ./tools/palm/hwTestSuite
    ./make.sh

#### MuExpDriver for Palm OS
Install prc-tools from the below link(self compiled or prepackaged VM)  

    cd ./tools/palm/muExpansionDriver
    ./make.sh

## Running

#### Files

 * `palmos40-en-m500.rom`:
   * `f50e4d5e4d98dc831f2c34a9107651eb` (MD5)  
 * `palmos41-en-m515.rom`:
   * `83cb1d1c76e568b916dc2e7c0bf669f6` (MD5)  
 * `palmos52-en-t3.rom`:
   * `de46ec84d9aabf655eabdf9b00a3845d` (MD5)   
 * `bootloader-dbvz.rom`:
   * `9da101cd2317830649a31f8fa46debec` (MD5)  

#### For Qt

 1. Run once to create the directory tree
 2. Copy "palmos41-en-m515.rom" and "palmos52-en-t3.rom" to "~/Mu"
 3. (Optional)Copy "bootloader-en-m515.rom" to "~/Mu"
 4. Run emu and press start button

#### For RetroArch

 1. Download "Palm OS(Mu)" from "Online Updater->Core Updater" 
     1. Alternatively, you can install a locally compiled or
        downloaded core from another source and place it within
        RetroArch's `cores/` directory. If you do this, remember
        to also install `mu_libretro.info` (which is located
        in `libretroBuildSystem`) to the directory as well so
        it knows which files are supported.
 2. Go back, select _Load Core_, select _Palm OS (Mu)_
 3. Copy `palmos41-en-m515.rom` to the RetroArch system directory
    1. For experimental Palm OS 5 support: `palmos52-en-t3.rom`.
 4. (Optional) Copy "bootloader-en-m515.rom" to the RetroArch system directory
 5. Load a `.prc`, `.img`, or `.zip` file.
